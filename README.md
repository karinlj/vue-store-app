# Vue Store App

## Description

Vue Store App - Assignment for Ellos.
Built with Vite + Vue.js.

### Header:

Search and Cart are non clickable in this app.

### Home page:

In the main header nav 'Products' go to 'dammode as default'.
The deep links 'Dam' and 'Herr' go to different routes, the others are non clickable in this app.
All the links on the big images go to 'dammode as default'.
At the bottom there is a link to products page for 'dammode'

### Products page:

The links on the products do not go to a single product in this app.
At the bottom there is a link to go to top of page.

Another time I would have wanted to use Typescript and write some tests.

Enjoy!
